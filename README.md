#### Note: The project is in earlier stage and only supports english and italian wikipedia episode list.

A Flutter desktop application which allows to rename a list of TV-series episodes.
In order to rename the episodes, the user has to paste the corresponding season TV-series wikipedia URL.
Episodes must be saved in a single folder, and there should not be any other file in that folder.

Unlike other rename softwares such as "Advanced Renamer", this program does not apply a set of rules to rename files.
Instead, it searches the episode number from every file in the folder, using it to match the correct episode name from the provided wiki url.

There are just some rules which are helpful to correctly identify the episode number in files, and a few rules to format episode names.
